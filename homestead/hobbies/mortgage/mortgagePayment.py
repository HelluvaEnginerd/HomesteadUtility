# principal = amount borrowed (house price - down payment applied towards overall price)
# r = annual interest rate (APR) / 12 months
# N = total number of payments being made (30 year fixed = 30 years * 12 payments/year = 360 payments)
#

# monthy mortgage payment = principal * (r*(1+r)^N)/((1+r)^N-1)

# other factors: mortgage insurance, homeowners insurance, HOA, property taxes
